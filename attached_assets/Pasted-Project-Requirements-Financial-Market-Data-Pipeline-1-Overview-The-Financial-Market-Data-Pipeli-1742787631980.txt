Project Requirements: Financial Market Data Pipeline
üìç 1. Overview
The Financial Market Data Pipeline is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to fetch financial data from FRED API, process it using Python libraries, store it in MySQL, and visualize it using React (Plotly, Matplotlib, Visual-Structuring-Core).

üìç 2. Functional Requirements (FRs)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion (ETL Process)
Fetch financial market data from FRED API.

Allow scheduled updates (daily/hourly) to keep data fresh.

Store raw data in a MySQL database.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Processing & Analysis
Clean & transform the financial data (handle missing values, normalize, etc.).

Perform statistical analysis (mean, variance, correlation).

Implement time series forecasting using Statsmodels, SciPy, Lmfit.

Cache frequently accessed data using Redis.

3Ô∏è‚É£ API Development (FastAPI)
Create RESTful APIs to:

Retrieve financial data from MySQL.

Fetch preprocessed & aggregated data for visualization.

Provide real-time market trends.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization (React + Plotly)
Build an interactive dashboard using React + Plotly to visualize:

Historical trends of market data (line charts).

Correlation between economic indicators (scatter plots).

Moving Averages & Volatility (candlestick charts).

Predictions based on time series models.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication & Security
Implement API authentication (JWT or OAuth2).

Secure database connections with SSL.

Restrict API rate limits to prevent abuse.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment & Scalability
Deploy backend on AWS EC2 using Docker.

Use AWS RDS for MySQL database.

Configure Nginx as API Gateway.

Set up CI/CD pipelines for automatic deployment.

üìç 3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Performance & Scalability
API response time should be < 200ms.

Use Redis caching for frequently accessed data.

Support parallel processing for data ingestion.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Reliability & Fault Tolerance
Implement error handling for API failures.

Log requests & errors using structured logging (ELK, CloudWatch).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Maintainability & Documentation
Use clean architecture (separate layers for API, services, and DB).

Provide Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for APIs.

Write unit tests for core functionality.
